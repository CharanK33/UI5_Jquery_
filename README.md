# Model App (SAPUI5 + jQuery)

This is a simple SAPUI5 application where users can view Rivian R2 and R3 car models, guess their launch year, and get instant feedback. Along with standard UI5 features, jQuery is used to improve the user experience with animations and effects.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Switch between R2 and R3 car models using a segmented button
- Image updates based on the selected model
- Input field for users to guess the launch year
- Feedback message shown at the top of the screen
- Shake animation when the guess is incorrect
- Zoom-in effect on the image when hovered

---

## ‚ú® jQuery Usage

We used jQuery in a few specific places to enhance the UI:

- **Smooth image change:**  
  When the user switches models, the image fades out and slides in smoothly using jQuery.

- **Shake effect for wrong input:**  
  If the user enters an incorrect year, the input field shakes briefly to show it's wrong.

- **Tooltip on image:**  
  A dynamic tooltip is set using jQuery, showing which model is currently displayed.

- **Toast repositioning:**  
  Feedback messages appear at the top of the screen instead of overlapping the input area.

These enhancements are done using `this.byId("...").$()` to safely access DOM elements managed by UI5. Original UI5-only logic is commented out in the controller for reference.
